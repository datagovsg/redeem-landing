            <div class="answer">
              <p>Each person can only redeem their quota. Any additional redemption requests should be declined. If a person insists they did not redeem but it is shown in the system that they redeemed, you can still click “redeem anyway” and log this as an appeal case.</p>

            <div class="question"><i class='bx bxs-chevron-right' ></i> Does your system allow child mask redemption? Can a child redeem an adult’s mask?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Our system detects that if a NRIC is T08 and younger, or in the G series, there will be an option to select Child or Adult masks. Children can redeem an adult mask if they prefer that. </p>

            <div class="answer">
              <p>No. If our system is able to detect that an NRIC belongs to an adult (above 12 years old), they will only be able to redeem an adult mask, as child masks are more scarce and we need to reserve it for the younger children. </p>

      <h3>Adding and Changing Collection Points </h3>

            <div class="question"><i class='bx bxs-chevron-right' ></i> I get stuck at the “Add collection point” page. How can I start using the app?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Please find your collection point’s Point-of-Contact (POC) and scan their QR code to add a collection point.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, have them send the QR code over whatsapp to your fellow volunteers/ staff or print the QR code out for scanning. These QR codes change each day, so you will need to scan the QR code every day to update redemption.</p>

            <div class="answer">
              <p>QR codes are valid each day till 11.59pm, and reset and midnight. This is to ensure that volunteers who only help out with 1-2 days will not be able to update redemption for the other days.</p>
