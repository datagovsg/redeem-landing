                      <ul>
                        <li>A mobile app used by agency officers and merchants to update redemption,</li>
                        <li>An admin portal that allows agencies to manage their campaign and view statistics, and </li>
                        <li>API that merchants can integrate with to update redemption. </li>

                    <p>Any government agency and its affiliate partners can use RedeemSG. We also assess requests from charities on a case by case basis.</p>
                    <p>To gain access to the system, you will need to contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@redeem.gov.sg">feedback@redeem.gov.sg</a> to set up a campaign.
                      <ul>
                        <li>We will need to add mobile numbers of Campaign administrators and operations personnel before you and your colleagues can start using the mobile app for a particular campaign. </li>
                        <li>We will add your mobile numbers such that you will be able to access a campaign on the admin portal. </li>

                    <p>Alternatively, have them send the QR code over whatsapp to your fellow volunteers/ staff or print the QR code out for scanning. These QR codes change each day, so you will need to scan the QR code every day to update redemption.
