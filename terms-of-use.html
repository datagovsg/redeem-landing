                  The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or
                  use of software or services of a third party (“<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>”). In such an event,
                  there may be terms of use of the
                  third party software or service (the “<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>”). GovTech may be required
                  under or as a result of the
                  Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply
                  to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose
                  acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third
                  Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third
                  Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard
                  form terms of the distribution platform from which you
                  obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or
                  Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or
                  user of the distribution platform (the “<strong>Distribution Terms</strong>”). Information on the
                  Third Party Terms are embedded in
                  the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use,
                  publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise
                  listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
                  insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms,
                  the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the
                  specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the
                  software or application that is part of the Service. For
                  example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play
                  Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution
                  Terms.
