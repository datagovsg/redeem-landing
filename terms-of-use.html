        <strong>Account Access and Security</strong>

        <div style="margin-left:2.4em;">
          <p>
            3A.1 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any
            authentication credentials associated with your use of the Service, including the
            security of any of your devices which store the authentication credentials.
          </p>

          <p>
            3A.2GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to verify the identity of the person
            using the Service.  Without prejudice to the foregoing, GovTech is not under any duty to
            verify that any biometric identifier used with the Service, or on your device, belongs
            to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            3A.3 GovTech shall have the sole and absolute discretion to invalidate any
            authentication credentials at any time, or require you to have to re-authenticate or
            refresh your authentication credentials at any time, without having to give any reason
            for the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            3A.4 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to act upon or rely on any
            instructions, information, transmissions of data, or communications received from the
            account or use of the Service in relation to your authentication credentials, as if such
            instructions, information, data or communications were issued by you, whether or not the
            same was authorized by you.
          </p>

          <p>
            3A.5For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss of whatever
            nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications made to your device which
            permit or escalate privileged access, or remove restrictions to such access, which are
            not intended by the manufacturer or provider of your device or operating system of your
            device (e.g., “rooting” or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone).

      <li>
        <strong>Third Party Materials</strong>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services
            of a third party (
            <strong>“Third Party”</strong>

            ). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service
            (the
            <strong>“Third Party Terms”</strong>

            ). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you
            of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose
            acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the
            Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard
            form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service
            (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or
            user of the distribution platform (the
            <strong>“Distribution Terms”</strong>

            ). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted
            for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise
            listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4
            relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the
            specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is
            part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play
            Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these
              Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same.
            </strong>

            In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech
            (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree
            to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you
            as the end user.  For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are listed, such
            Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use
            policies as are applicable to you.
          </li>

          <li>
            If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third
            Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to
            be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:
            <ol>
              <li>
                some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct
                licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such
                cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and
              </li>

              <li>
                the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the
                relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain
            terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum
            standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to
            have been so incorporated (the
            <strong>“Incorporated Terms”</strong>

            ). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you
            notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you
            acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly
            require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied
            with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered
            but only to the extent necessary for compliance.
          </li>

          <li>
            Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third
            Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary,
            against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these
            Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such
            direct rights of enforcement against you.
          </li>

          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any
            inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall
            prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech
            beyond that stated in Clause 6.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device</strong>

        <p>
          Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of
          your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or
          the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Please also see clause 8
          (Privacy Policy). Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by
          the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service.

          <p>
            5B.1  If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or a Third
            Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is otherwise reasonably
            understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively, “Confidential Information”),
            you shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the
            purpose for which it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential
            Information to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or
            omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall be deemed to be
            your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for the same. In all cases, you
            shall protect the Confidential Information to the same extent you protect your own
            confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You
            shall ensure that any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as
            restrictive as this Clause.
          </p>

          <p>
            5B.2   You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon request by
            GovTech or the Third Party.

            5B.3.1   you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose

          <p style="margin-left:2.4em;">
            5B.3.2   you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or disclosure or
            reproduction of Confidential Information;
          </p>

          you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and cooperate with
          GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure.

        <strong>Nature of Service</strong>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            This Service facilitates the tracking of the distribution and redemption of goods,
            vouchers and tickets (collectively,
            <strong>“Items”</strong>

            ). The “campaign” in this Schedule refers to any such distribution programme. The Terms
            of Use apply to you whether you are a distributor of the Items, or the redeemer of such
            Items. The Service includes, without limitation, APIs and administrative interfaces.
            GovTech reserves the right to withhold from you or terminate certain functionalities of
            the Service. For example, if you are a redeemer of a voucher, you will not be granted
            access to the administrator portal for tracking redemption which is used by the
            distributor.
          </li>

          <li>
            GovTech

            <strong>DOES NOT</strong>

            manage and is

            <strong>NOT</strong>

            responsible for the fulfilment and quality of the operations involved in redemption of
            the Items. As such, it is not responsible for ensuring adequate supply of the Items. It
            is also not responsible for any other services required for the campaign’s operations -
            e.g. internet disruption at collection points, advertising, or crown control measures.
            If you as campaign owner have partnered with merchants for distribution or redemption of
            your tickets or vouchers, you are responsible for reimbursing such merchants.
            Conversely, if you are a merchant distributing goods to be redeemed by tickets/vouchers
            or to which such tickets/vouchers relate, you are responsible for seeking reimbursement
            from the campaign owner. GovTech is not responsible for the terms of distribution or
            redemption, if any, between the campaign owner and the merchant.
          </li>

          <li>
            GovTech

            <strong>DOES NOT</strong>

            own or decide on the parameters for each distribution campaign, such as the Items
            distributed and value of such Items. It does not provide the eligibility criteria or
            recipient list for the campaign. It does not manage the sign up of recipients,
            verifiers, merchants and administrators of the campaign. It also does not determine the
            stakeholders involved and timeframe for each campaign.
          </li>

          <li>
            GovTech

            <strong>DOES NOT</strong>

            handle any payment to or accept refunds from merchants for vouchers used at their
            stores. It is not responsible for accounting, financial reporting, financial
            reconciliation, financial governance and audit entailed in voucher distribution
            programmes.
          </li>

          <li>
            GovTech is

            <strong>NOT</strong>

            responsible for the terms of voucher/ticket use at each merchant. Insofar as a merchant
            is involved in a campaign, any issues concerning payment (such as refunds and
            cancellations) should be directed to the merchant or campaign owner.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you are a distributor of the Items, it is your responsibility to ensure that any
            terms or privacy policies concerning the distribution or redemption which you require
            are communicated to the persons receiving the Items, or to the person distributing the
            goods that are to be redeemed or to which the tickets/vouchers which are to be redeemed
            relate (such as partner merchants). Your terms and privacy policy must be consistent
            with the terms herein. In certain cases, you might be requested to provide GovTech with
            a copy of your terms to determine issues concerning redemption of the Item.
          </li>

          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt, partner merchants are also deemed to be distributors and are
            bound to these Terms of Use.
          </li>

          <li>
            Distributors of Items are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws,
            including without limitation the Personal Data Protection Act and Spam Control Act.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you are a redeemer of Items, you are to note that the distributor may impose
            additional terms or privacy policies to the redemption of the Items.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you are the campaign organizer (such as the voucher/ticket issuer), you are required
            to agree to additional terms in order to use the Service. Please check with GovTech for
            details on these additional terms.
