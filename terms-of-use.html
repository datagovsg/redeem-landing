In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “<strong>Distribution Terms</strong>”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise indicated in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.

                  This Service facilitates the tracking of the redemption of vouchers (which includes any tickets,
                  chits, or other similar documents for exchange or redemption). The “campaign” in this Schedule
                  refers to any such redemption programme. The Terms of Use apply to you whether you are a campaign
                  organizer, individual redeeming a voucher, system integrating with RedeemSG or using any RedeemSG
                  APIs, or merchant participating in a campaign using RedeemSG. The Service includes, without
                  limitation, APIs and administrative interfaces. GovTech reserves the right to withhold from you or
                  terminate certain functionalities of the Service. For example, if you are a redeemer of a voucher,
                  you will not be granted access to the administrator portal for tracking redemption which is used by
                  the campaign organizer or merchant.

                  organizers or merchants provide the items in exchange for a voucher. It is also not responsible for
                  any other services required for the campaign’s operations - e.g. internet disruption at collection
                  points, advertising, or crowd control measures. If you as campaign organizer have partnered with
                  merchants for the redemption of your vouchers, you are responsible for reimbursing such merchants
                  and for working with merchants to ensure the quality of operations. Conversely, if you are a
                  merchant accepting these vouchers, you are responsible for seeking reimbursement from the campaign
                  owner. GovTech is not responsible for the terms of distribution or redemption, if any, between the
                  campaign organizer and the merchant.
