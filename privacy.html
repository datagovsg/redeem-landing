            This is a Government agency digital service. This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction
            with the Terms of Use that accompany the applicable service you are requesting from us (the
            <strong>“Service”</strong>

            ). In this Privacy Policy,

            <strong>“Public Sector Entities”</strong>

            means the Government (including its ministries, departments and organs of state) and public
            authorities (such as statutory boards).
          </li>

          <li>
            Insofar as the Service consists of or is provided to you through a website, please note
            that:

              <li>
                We may use "cookies", where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track
                information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track
                information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users
                and their preferred sites. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and
                which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
              </li>

              <li>
                You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
                prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            We may request certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of the
            Service. The data that may be requested include those identified in the Annex herein. Your
            data may be stored in our servers, systems or devices, in the servers, systems or devices of
            our third party service providers or collaborators, or on your device, and may be used by us
            or our third party service providers or collaborators to facilitate your access or use of
            the Service. We or our third party service providers or collaborators may collect system
            configuration information and/or traffic information (such as an IP address) and/or use
            information or statistical information to operate, maintain or improve the Services or the
            underlying service of the third party service provider or collaborator. For the avoidance of
            doubt, in this Privacy Policy, a reference to a third party service provider or collaborator
            includes other third parties who provide a service or collaborate with our third party
            service provider or collaborator.
          </li>

                We may use, disclose and process the data for any one or more of the following

                  <li>

                    with us or any other Public Sector Entity or third party service provider or

                    to carry out your instructions or respond to any queries, feedback or complaints

                    the purposes of responding to or dealing with your interactions with us;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    to monitor and track your usage of the Service, to conduct research, data analytics,

                    (including any service of a third party service provider or collaborator) and other
                    services and products provided by Public Sector Entities. For the avoidance of
                    doubt, we may also collect, use, disclose and process such information to create
                    reports and produce statistics regarding your transactions with us and your usage of
                    the Services and other services and products provided by Public Sector Entities for

                    externally);
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    for the purposes of storing or creating backups of your data (whether for
                    contingency or business continuity purposes or otherwise), whether within or outside
                    Singapore;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    to enable us to contact you or communicate with you on any matters relating to your
                    access or use of the Service, including but not limited to the purposes set out
                    above, via email, SMS, instant messaging, push notifications or such other forms of
                    communication that we may introduce from time to time depending on the functionality
                    of the Service and/or your device.

              </li>

              <li>
                We may share necessary data with other Public Sector Entities, and third party service
                providers in connection with the Service, so as to provide the Service to you in the
                most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited by law.
              </li>

              <li>
                We will NOT share your personal data with entities which are not Public Sector Entities,
                except where such sharing is necessary for such entities to assist us in providing the
                Service to you or for fulfilling any of the purposes herein.
              </li>

              <li>
                For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us or
                other Public Sector Entities.  This will speed up the transaction and save you the
                trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply
                us the latest data.

            governing the use/provision of any service of a third party service provider or
            collaborator.
          </li>

          <li>
            To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data is
            secured with appropriate security technologies.

            You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your data by us with reasonable
            notice and subject to any prevailing legal or contractual restrictions; however, doing so

            The Service may contain links to external sites whose data protection and privacy practices
