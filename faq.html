                  <p>RedeemSG is a voucher system for the Singapore Government. It helps to digitize vouchers and
                    redemption tracking, thereby eliminating the manual work of collecting vouchers and digitizing
                    records. This comprises of:
                  <ul>
                    <li>An admin portal that allows Government agencies to manage a voucher campaign, from creating
                      vouchers, sending vouchers, to tracking the redemption records.</li>
                    <li>A merchant app that allows Merchants to easily accept vouchers by scanning the voucher QR codes.
                    </li>
                    <li>APIs that merchants can integrate with to accept Government issued vouchers.</li>
                    <li>E-vouchers that get sent to voucher recipients via SMS that open up in a weblink.</li>

                  </span>
                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>In response to ground feedback and suggestions received from participating merchants and hawkers
                    during the first two tranches, we have digitized to improve the voucher claiming and redemption
                    experience:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduce the operational load on <u>merchants</u></strong> to collect, count, and hand
                      over vouchers to the merchant association POC, who then have to bring the vouchers down to the CC.
                      With the RedeemSG solution, merchants can easily accept vouchers by scanning the vouchers, and see
                      a tally of their daily transactions/ payouts. </li>
                    <li><strong>Trim the time it takes for merchants to get paid.</strong>Merchants used to have to
                      wait weeks or months
                      to get paid due to the time they need to collect, handover vouchers, and then bring it down to the
                      CC and consequent time for backend processing of the payment request. With digitalization,
                      merchants get paid the next day. </li>
                    <li><strong>Paper vouchers are troublesome for <u>residents </u></strong>- need to go to CCs to
                      collect (despite residents
                      needing to socially distance for public health reasons in light of the COVID situation),
                      troublesome, easy to lose vouchers. With digital vouchers, residents can sign up online and claim
                      vouchers without needing to go down to the CC. </li>
                    <li><strong>Saves public monies/ operational cost in the administration of the voucher
                        programme.</strong> No longer
                      requires staff going down to collect vouchers (even in the rain), having a physical counting
                      machine for paper vouchers, writing down on paper, scanning and digitizing records, and then
                      keeping the vouchers for up to 7 years in case of audit queries. </li>

                  <div class="icon"></div><span>Did you test the vouchers with any merchants and residents to make sure
                    it is workable? How did you arrive at the current design?

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>This is the first time CDC vouchers are digital (all previous tranches of CDC Vouchers have been
                    paper vouchers). Open Government Products, Govtech worked closely with CDC to identify the key
                    problems digital vouchers aimed to tackle, and conducted 8 on-the-ground trials with real merchants
                    and residents to ensure the final solution is intuitive, inclusive, and easy to use.
                  <ul>
                    <li>First trials conducted were with internal staff before we even test with residents</li>
                    <li>Then, we tested with small groups at a time different overall flows to see what works best e.g.
                      e-wallet vs merchant scanning vs no app download </li>
                    <li>Subsequent trials helped to fine tune specific parts of the product - adding of merchant users,
                      combining of different voucher denominations, etc. </li>
                    <li>Finally, the November beta trial allowed us to identify kinks that can occur at scale </li>
                  </ul>
                  From each trial, we listened to feedback from the residents and merchants to improve the user
                  experience for them e.g. allowing customers to use multiple vouchers at once to speed up merchant
                  scanning process, providing smaller voucher denominations so that vouchers can be used at hawkers etc.

                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>We had previously trialled a version of the “SGQR” model in which a customer would scan the
                    merchant’s QR code. While this is technically possible, we identified it would come with the
                    following drawbacks:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Less digitally savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme as they do not have the means
                      to scan merchants QR code if they do not download an app
                      <ul>
                        <li>Option to still provide paper vouchers would mean merchants need to cater to 2 completely
                          different workflow (some via paynow, some via paper vouchers)
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Based on feedback from previous trials, we found that less digitally savvy residents also find
                      it confusing to key in/ select the exact amount they want to redeem when using an e-wallet method.
                    </li>
                    <li>E-Wallet requires all Singaporean households to download a mobile app to be able to claim and
                      redeem the vouchers, which is not practical for a one-off scheme . </li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To ensure the digitally savvy will not be excluded by the digital scheme, we have designed the
                    solution such that there will be the same workflow for both merchants and residents for both
                    <u>paper</u> and <u>digital</u> vouchers.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Merchants - can <u>scan vouchers</u> regardless of digital or paper</li>
                    <li>Residents - <u>present the voucher</u> regardless of digital or paper</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The above reduces the overall cost on taxpayers’ monies in operationalising the system by a factor
                    of
                    almost 40%.

                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>After consultations with merchants, we have determined that the $2, $5 and $10 were the 3 best
                    preferred denominations to cater to a range of purchases - e.g. to cover purchases of both drinks
                    and food at the hawkers and other items/ services at heartland shops (e.g. groceries, haircuts).
                  </p>
                  <p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations to provide the ease of reconciliation for merchants and
                    reduce the chance for errors to occur when consumers key in the amount. Having it in fixed
                    denominations also takes reference from the terms of use for vouchers by other commonly used
                    vouchers - e.g. NTUC vouchers, grab vouchers.
