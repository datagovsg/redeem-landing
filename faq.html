                  <p>RedeemSG is a voucher system for the Singapore Government. It helps to digitize vouchers and
                    redemption tracking, thereby eliminating the manual work of collecting vouchers and digitizing
                    records. This comprises of:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An admin portal that allows Government agencies to manage a voucher campaign, from creating
                      vouchers, sending vouchers, to tracking the redemption records. </li>
                    <li>A merchant app that allows Merchants to easily accept vouchers by scanning the voucher QR codes
                    </li>
                    <li>APIs that merchants can integrate with to accept Government issued vouchers.E-vouchers that get
                      sent to voucher recipients via SMS that open up in a weblink.</li>

                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>CDCs have, in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech digitized the vouchers in
                    response
                    to suggestions of hawkers and heartland merchants to have faster pay-outs, accurate tracking of
                    transactions and reduce the need for them to collect, count and hand over paper vouchers.
                    Residents
                    also no longer need to visit the CC to collect their paper vouchers, and thereby enjoy greater
                    convenience.</p>
                  <p>After taking in feedback from hawkers, heartland merchants and residents and iterating on the
                    flow
                    based on several trials with them since April 2021, we have developed this improved flow which
                    involves vouchers being issued and tracked digitally as the primary mode. Equipped with a mobile
                    app
                    to easily accept vouchers, merchants will enjoy faster payouts, accurate tracking of transactions
                    and no longer need to collect, count and hand over paper vouchers. With the digital means to claim
                    and vouchers, residents no longer need to come down to the CC to collect their paper vouchers,
                    promoting social distancing and public health in light of COVID-19.</p>
                  <p>To ensure no resident is left behind, residents claiming both digital or physical vouchers can
                    similarly spend their vouchers at the merchants by showing the QR code for the merchant to scan.
                  </p>
                  <p>For those who need help claiming their e-vouchers, they may seek the help of a household member
                    who
                    is digitally more savvy to assist them in claiming the voucher as the voucher is assigned to the
                    household. If the less digitally savvy need help, they can visit the CC where Singpass set up /
                    reset counters are set up and there are also staff who can assist them to claim or print physical
                    vouchers. </p>

                  class="question">
                  <div class="icon"></div><span>Did you test the vouchers with any merchants and residents to make
                    sure
                    it is workable? How did you arrive at the current design?</span>
                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>This is the first time CDC vouchers are digital (all previous tranches of CDC Vouchers have been
                    paper vouchers). Open Government Products (GovTech) worked closely with CDC to identify the key
                    problems digital vouchers aimed to tackle, and conducted 8 on-the-ground trials with real
                    merchants
                    and residents to ensure the final solution is intuitive, inclusive, and easy to use.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>First, trials conducted were with internal staff before we tested it with residents. </li>
                    <li>Then, we tested with small groups at a time different overall flows to see what flow works
                      best
                      e.g. residents scanning the merchant's QR, residents keying in a 6-digit merchant PIN etc. </li>
                    <li>Subsequent trials helped to fine tune specific parts of the product - how merchant users
                      should
                      be added, how different denominations should be combined, etc. </li>
                    <li>Finally, the Nov 2021 beta trial allowed us to identify issues that can occur at scale. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>From each trial, we listened to feedback from the residents and merchants to improve the user
                    experience for them respectively.</p>

                  <div class="icon"></div><span>Hawkers and merchants are busy. Why do they need to be the ones
                    scanning
                    the QR code and not the customer like with SGQR?</span>
                </label>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>CDCs in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech, had previously tested the model in
                    which the customer scans the merchant's QR. While this is technically possible, we identified it
                    would come with the following drawbacks:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If customers were to scan merchants' QR, all citizens will need to download a mobile app.</li>
                    <li>Digitally less savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme if they do not download an
                      app
                      or have an e-wallet, unless we specially cater for paper vouchers on top of the e-wallet (which
                      will result in much higher public costs in administering the scheme arising from printing and
                      paper voucher distribution costs).</li>
                    <li>We have also found through previous trials with residents and found that selecting the exact
                      amount to be spent (as in an e-wallet model) was confusing for some residents and error prone.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To ensure that the digital system caters to both digitally savvy and less digitally savvy
                    residents, we have designed the digital solution such that merchants and residents will have the
                    same workflow regardless of whether digital or paper is used -- residents will present the
                    digital/
                    paper voucher, and merchants will scan digital/paper vouchers. </p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>After consultations with merchants, we have determined that the $2, $5 and $10 were the 3 best
                    preferred denominations to cater to a range of purchases - e.g. to cover purchases of both drinks
                    and food at the hawkers and other items/ services at heartland shops (e.g. groceries, haircuts).
                  </p>
                  <p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations to provide the ease of reconciliation for merchants and
                    reduce the chance for errors to occur when consumers key in the amount. Having it in fixed
                    denominations also takes reference from the terms of use for vouchers by other commonly used
                    vouchers - e.g. NTUC vouchers, grab vouchers. </p>
