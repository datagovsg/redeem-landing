    - q: What is RedeemSG?
      a: |
        RedeemSG is a voucher system for the Singapore Government. It helps to digitize vouchers and redemption tracking, thereby eliminating the manual work of collecting vouchers and digitizing records. This comprises of:

        - An admin portal that allows Government agencies to manage a voucher campaign, from creating vouchers, sending vouchers, to tracking the redemption records. 
        - A merchant app that allows Merchants to easily accept vouchers by scanning the voucher QR codes 
        - APIs that merchants can integrate with to accept Government issued vouchers. 
        E-vouchers that get sent to voucher recipients via SMS that open up in a weblink.
    
 
    - q: Who can use RedeemSG?

    - q: Who is eligible for CDC Vouchers? 
      a: |
        All Singaporean households are eligible for the scheme. Each household can claim $100 in CDC vouchers that can be spent at participating merchants. 

        (As the intent of this current tranche is to foster a sense of solidarity amongst Singaporeans and support heartland merchants and hawkers, the eligibility criteria for this tranche is different from previous CDC voucher tranches where only some households were eligible for the vouchers).

        You can redeem the CDC voucher at any of the participating merchants that can be identified by this particular CDC Voucher Decal.

    - q: Where can I redeem the CDC voucher?

      a: |
        Yes. Help will be available at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) for those without smartphones, data plan or who need to set up their Singpass or reset their Singpass password during the CDC Vouchers Scheme duration. Seniors without household members to help them to claim their CDC vouchers, as well as the digitally less savvy, will be given priority when seeking help at CCs. In appropriate cases, there will also be the option of printing hardcopy vouchers at the CCs.

        In addition, SG Digital Community hubs found in selected CCs and libraries island-wide will be available to help digitally less-savvy residents claim their digital vouchers. The Silver Generation Office Ambassadors will also assist with any queries or request for assistance during their house visits to seniors.

      a: If the voucher value is more than the purchase value, any unused amount / remaining value of the voucher will not be refunded.

    - q: Why digitize vouchers?
      a: |
        CDCs have, in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech digitized the vouchers in response to suggestions of hawkers and heartland merchants to have faster pay-outs, accurate tracking of transactions and reduce the need for them to collect, count and hand over paper vouchers. Residents also no longer need to visit the CC to collect their paper vouchers, and thereby enjoy greater convenience.

        After taking in feedback from hawkers, heartland merchants and residents and iterating on the flow based on several trials with them since April 2021, we have developed this improved flow which involves vouchers being issued and tracked digitally as the primary mode. Equipped with a mobile app to easily accept vouchers, merchants will enjoy faster payouts, accurate tracking of transactions and no longer need to collect, count and hand over paper vouchers.  With the digital means to claim and vouchers, residents no longer need to come down to the CC to collect their paper vouchers, promoting social distancing and public health in light of COVID-19.
            
        To ensure no resident is left behind, residents claiming both digital or physical vouchers can similarly spend their vouchers at the merchants by showing the QR code for the merchant to scan. 

        For those who need help claiming their e-vouchers, they may seek the help of a household member who is digitally more savvy to assist them in claiming the voucher as the voucher is assigned to the household. If the less digitally savvy need help, they can visit the CC where Singpass set up / reset counters are set up and there are also staff who can assist them to claim or print physical vouchers. 

    - q: Did you test the vouchers with any merchants and residents to make sure it is workable? How did you arrive at the current design? 
      a: |
        This is the first time CDC vouchers are digital (all previous tranches of CDC Vouchers have been paper vouchers). Open Government Products (GovTech) worked closely with CDC to identify the key problems digital vouchers aimed to tackle, and conducted 8 on-the-ground trials with real merchants and residents to ensure the final solution is intuitive, inclusive, and easy to use.

        - First, trials conducted were with internal staff before we tested it with residents. 
        - Then, we tested with small groups at a time different overall flows to see what flow works best e.g. residents scanning the merchant's QR, residents keying in a 6-digit merchant PIN etc. 
        - Subsequent trials helped to fine tune specific parts of the product - how merchant users should be added, how different denominations should be combined, etc. 
        - Finally, the Nov 2021 beta trial allowed us to identify issues that can occur at scale. 

        From each trial, we listened to feedback from the residents and merchants to improve the user experience for them respectively.

    - q: Hawkers and merchants are busy. Why do they need to be the ones scanning the QR code and not the customer like with SGQR? 
      a: |
        CDCs in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech, had previously tested the model in which the customer scans the merchant's QR. While this is technically possible, we identified it would come with the following drawbacks:

        1. If customers were to scan merchants' QR, all citizens will need to download a mobile app.
        2. Digitally less savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme if they do not download an app or have an e-wallet, unless we specially cater for paper vouchers on top of the e-wallet (which will result in much higher public costs in administering the scheme arising from printing and paper voucher distribution costs).
        3. We have also found through previous trials with residents and found that selecting the exact amount to be spent (as in an e-wallet model) was confusing for some residents and error prone.

        To ensure that the digital system caters to both digitally savvy and less digitally savvy residents, we have designed the digital solution such that merchants and residents will have the same workflow regardless of whether digital or paper is used -- residents will present the digital/ paper voucher, and merchants will scan digital/paper vouchers. 

    - q: Why are the vouchers in fixed denominations ($2, $5, $10) for the current tranche? 
      a: |
        After consultations with merchants, we have determined that the $2, $5 and $10 were the 3 best preferred denominations to cater to a range of purchases - e.g. to cover purchases of both drinks and food at the hawkers and other items/ services at heartland shops (e.g. groceries, haircuts).  

        The vouchers are in fixed denominations to provide the ease of reconciliation for merchants and reduce the chance for errors to occur when consumers key in the amount. Having it in fixed denominations also takes reference from the terms of use for vouchers by other commonly used vouchers - e.g. NTUC vouchers, grab vouchers. 

    - q: Why can't the CDCs consider giving out cash through direct credit to the bank account instead? 
      a: CDC digital vouchers are designed to be spent specifically at heartland merchants and hawkers to support them as their businesses were negatively affected by the pandemic.
