    - q: What is RedeemSG?
      a: |
        RedeemSG is a voucher system for the Singapore Government. It helps to digitize vouchers and redemption tracking, thereby eliminating the manual work of collecting vouchers and digitizing records. This comprises of:

        - An admin portal that allows Government agencies to manage a voucher campaign, from creating vouchers, sending vouchers, to tracking the redemption records. 
        - A merchant app that allows Merchants to easily accept vouchers by scanning the voucher QR codes 
        - APIs that merchants can integrate with to accept Government issued vouchers. 
        E-vouchers that get sent to voucher recipients via SMS that open up in a weblink.
    
 
    - q: Who can use RedeemSG?
      a: |
        Any government agency and its affiliate partners can use RedeemSG to create, send and track vouchers. We also assess requests from charities on a case by case basis. To create and gain access to a campaign, or to gain access to the portal, please contact us at feedback@redeem.gov.sg.
